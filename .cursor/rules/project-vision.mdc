# Praise - Multi-Tenant Church Management Platform

## Project Overview

Praise is a comprehensive multi-tenant church management mobile application built with React Native. It enables churches to manage their congregations, organize ministry teams, coordinate services, and facilitate communication within their community. The platform is designed to serve multiple independent churches, each with their own isolated data, members, and customizations.

## Core Concept

Each church operates independently within the app with complete data isolation and customizable workflows.
